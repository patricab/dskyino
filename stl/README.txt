# Summary

After extensive research to find exact dimensions of the real Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) Display/Keyboard (DSKY), we created these files in order to publish on Instructables the set of Open Source files and Instructions for anyone to build his own DSKY Replica before the famous 50th Anniversary of Neil Armstrong's first step on the Moon.
https://www.instructables.com/id/Open-Apollo-Guidance-Computer-DSKY/

We then LAUNCHED a Kickstarter (currently in progress with some Early Birds discounts still available) offering various pieces of our Open DSKY Replica. If you 3D print your enclosure yourself, you are already saving money on a kit!

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Clone
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .200
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
Please note that while the Bezel and Battery Box Lid can be printed on pretty much any 3D printer, the real DSKY was 7" wide by almost 8" high so those are the dimensions of our Top Plate, Mid Ring and Bottom which requires a 3D Printer that can at least print 180mm by 200mm.

We print the Bezel, Top Plate and Mid Ring on Grey material, while the Bottom and Battery Door are printed in Black.
